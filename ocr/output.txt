A LAST WILL.

HE was stronger and cleverei-,no d0ubt,than other men,
and in many broad lines of business he had grown rich,
until his wealth exceeded exaggeration. One morning,
in his otlice, he directed a request _to his contltlential law-
yer to come to him in the afternoon. He intended to have
his will drawn. A will is a solemn matter, even with men
whose life is given up to business, and who are by habit
mindful of the future. After giving this direction he took
up no other matter,but sat at his desk alone and in silence.

It was a day when summer was ﬁrst new. The pale
leaves upon the trees were starting forth upon the still
unbending branches. The grass in the parks had a fresh-
ness in its green like the freshness of the blue in the sky
and of the yellow of the sun—a freshness to make one
wish that life might renew its youth. The clear breezes
from the south wantoned about, and then were still, as if
loath to go ﬁnally away. Hair" idly, half thoughtfully
the rich man wrote upon the white paper before him, be-
ginning what he wrote with capital letters, such as he had
not made since, as a boy in school, he had taken pride in
his skill with the pen:

“ IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN. I, Charles
Lounsbnry, being of sound and disposing mind and men1~
ory [he lingered on the word memory], do now make and
publish this my LAST WILL AND ’l‘ES'l‘AMENT, in
order, as justly as I may, to distribute my interests in the
World among succeeding men.

“And ﬁrst, that part of my interests which is known in
the law and recognized in the sheep-bound volumes as
my property, being inconsiderable and of none account,
I make no account of it in this my will.

“My right to live, it being but a life-estate, is not at my
disposal, but, these things excepted, all else in the world
I now proceed to devise and bequeath:

“ Item.—Aud_ﬁ1'st, I give to good fathers and mothers,
but in trust for their children, nevertheless, all good little
words of praise and all quaint. pet names, and I charge
said parents to use them justly but generously as the
needs of their children shall require.

“Item:-1 leave to children exclusively, but only for
the life of their childhood, all and every, the rlandelions
of the ﬁelds and the daisies thereof,with the right to play
among them freely, according to the custom of children,
warning them at the same time against the thistles. And
I devise to children the yellow shores of creeks and the
golden sands beneath the waters thereof,with the dragon-
ﬂies that skim the surface of said waters, and the odors
of the willows that dip into said waters, and the white
clouds that ﬂoat high over the giant trees.
